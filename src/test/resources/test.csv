174,New Zealand,"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apéritif or with light dishes.",,88,19,Marlborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Stoneleigh 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Sauvignon Blanc,Stoneleigh,
311,New Zealand,"This wine is light in color, but still packs a mouthful of flavor. It's peppery and meaty upfront, filled out on the midpalate by tart fruit that verges on cranberry in flavor. Pretty rather than potent; drink now-2014.",,87,18,Hawke's Bay,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Otto's Constant Dream 2008 Syrah (Hawke's Bay),Syrah,Otto's Constant Dream,
696,New Zealand,"The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrus—think white grapefruit—and melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package.",Pioneer Block 20 Dillons Point Cash Block,91,28,Marlborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Saint Clair 2014 Pioneer Block 20 Dillons Point Cash Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Sauvignon Blanc,Saint Clair,
705,New Zealand,"Classic gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes feature gentle herbal nuances on the nose. There's ample weight and texture on the palate, with a burst of mouthwatering citrus on the finish.",,91,28,Marlborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Cloudy Bay 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Sauvignon Blanc,Cloudy Bay,
710,New Zealand,"As typical for Dry River Pinots, this one is pretty surly in its youth. Intense and astringent, it packs layers of dusty black-cherry fruit into a tightly coiled frame. Try after 2019.",,91,120,Martinborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Dry River 2013 Pinot Noir (Martinborough),Pinot Noir,Dry River,
714,New Zealand,"Alluring notes of Asian five spice and wet stone frame ripe cherry aromas in this medium-bodied wine. The texture is firm, becoming faintly dusty on the finish, but the wine is approachable now for its cherry fruit and appealing damp clay quality. Drink now–2018.",Bannockburn,91,50,Central Otago,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Akarua 2012 Bannockburn Pinot Noir (Central Otago),Pinot Noir,Akarua,
716,New Zealand,"Even Carrick's entry-level wine has turned out well in 2013, offering a sturdy, robust mouthful of dark fruit. Plum, espresso and dark chocolate mingle on the nose and palate, while the finish is long, faintly dusty and mouthwatering. Drink 2017–2025.",Unravelled,91,30,Central Otago,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Carrick 2013 Unravelled Pinot Noir (Central Otago),Pinot Noir,Carrick,
966,New Zealand,"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased. Kono's 2008 is on the light side, but tart and zippy, with a refreshing aspect to its pineapple and grapefruit flavors and herbal overtones. Drink now.",,85,9,Marlborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Sauvignon Blanc,Kono,
1032,New Zealand,"This is a soft, slightly sweet rendering of Pinot Gris, loaded with succulent pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Chill it well and sip it by the pool this summer.",,88,16,Marlborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Omaka Springs 2013 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),Pinot Gris,Omaka Springs,
1038,New Zealand,"This lacks a bit of midpalate richness, but otherwise offers fine drinking. Clove, cinnamon and leather complexities keep the cherry flavors interesting, while the finish is clean and crisp. Drink now.",Gimblett Gravels Reserve,87,20,Hawke's Bay,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Mills Reef 2012 Gimblett Gravels Reserve Merlot-Malbec (Hawke's Bay),Merlot-Malbec,Mills Reef,
1041,New Zealand,"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster. The aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar and dried herbs are pleasant, but carry with them a worring dry astringency. Try drinking this over the near term, with rare beef to help ameliorate the tannin's effects.",The Patriarch Premium,87,70,Hawke's Bay,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Babich 2011 The Patriarch Premium Red (Hawke's Bay),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Babich,
1131,New Zealand,"Despite some ripe, honeyed aromas, this is light in body and quite lean on the palate. Underripe pineapple flavors show a tart, herbal edge on the finish.",,84,16,Marlborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Chasing Venus 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Sauvignon Blanc,Chasing Venus,
1285,New Zealand,"This is a tart, lean, somewhat ungenerous Pinot Noir, but one that still manages to deliver an attractive, creative tension between its earthy, composty aromas and bright cranberry fruit.",,84,17,Marlborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Dashwood 2009 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),Pinot Noir,Dashwood,
1319,New Zealand,"A considerable step up in quality from the basic Yealands Sauvignon Blanc, this offering boasts attractive aromas of white grapefruit and pea tendrils. There's a silky texture and green, grassy elements on the palate, but they never stray too far into vegetal, finishing zesty and clean.",Single Vineyard,90,25,Awatere Valley,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Yealands 2016 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Awatere Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Yealands,
1327,New Zealand,"This plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay shows yellow fruit notes of mirabelle plum, peach and pineapple, all wrapped in a cocoon of woodsmoke. Drink now–2020.",Bannockburn,90,25,Central Otago,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Carrick 2015 Bannockburn Chardonnay (Central Otago),Chardonnay,Carrick,
1484,New Zealand,"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish.",Arona,85,11,Marlborough,,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Barker's Marque 2007 Arona Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),Sauvignon Blanc,Barker's Marque,
